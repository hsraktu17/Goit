# Goit â€“ A Git-like Version Control System in Go ðŸŒ€

Goit is a simplified version control system written in **Golang**, designed to mimic how Git works under the hood using **Merkle Trees**, **content-addressable storage**, and core concepts like **blobs**, **trees**, and **commits**.

> ðŸš§ This is a learning-focused project built to understand Git internals from scratch.
